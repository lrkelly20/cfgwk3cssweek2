  Exercises to complete this week:
  Exercise 3.1.1 - Make the links (anchors) in your footer italic using the font-style property

  Exercise 3.2.1 - On your navigation and footer classes, add some consistent 
                   padding to the top, left, bottom, and right using 0.5rem. 
                   This should provide some space between the content and the edge of the screen.
  Exercise 3.2.2 - Similar to the above, add some margins, again using 0.5rem, to your h1, h2, p, img 
                   elements in the main area of the page. You can then experiment with different amounts 
                   to make it look how you imagine. 

  Exercise 3.3.1 - Improve your navigation by making each item stack horizontally 
                   (inline) by using the display property.
  Exercise 3.3.2 - Make the copyright and social elements in your footer also 
                   stack horizontally (inline), again using the display property.

  Exercise 3.4.1 - Add a media query to your CSS which changes the background colour 
                   of your page body when you’re on desktop. Resize your browser window and see what happens. 
  Exercise 3.4.2 - Now update the media query from the previous exercise to change the font size as the page 
                   scales: 16px for mobile, 18px for desktop. If you don’t already have specific rem font 
                   sizing on your h1 or p elements, try this now and resize your browser window to see the effect.

  Exercise 3.5.1 - For desktop, make your introductory paragraph and image elements 50% of the width 
                   of their parent, and set that parent to display flex, and their direction to row. 
                   On mobile, make sure they are full width and block.
  Exercise 3.5.2 - On desktop, make the header display flex, and position your h1 and h2 elements 
                   in the center by using the align-items property.
